	Working with Generics
	
	Covariance
	
	Person is the superclass. Employee and Guest are subclasses.
	
	Inheritance: Person, Employee and Guest are covariants.
		So:
		Anywhere a Person reference is specified you can use Employee
		and Guest.
		
	Type Erasure: A list of Person and a list of Employee are not covariant
